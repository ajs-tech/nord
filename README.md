## Introduction

This repository holds different packages that are used internally by the toddle framework. The packages that are currently available are:

- core ðŸ‘ˆ holds core (shared) logic used by the other packages
- ssr ðŸ‘ˆ holds part of the server-side rendering logic

## Requirements

Install using [bun](https://bun.sh/) by running `bun install`

### Commands

- Lint: `bun lint`
- Check types: `bun typecheck`
- Test: `bun test`

## Status

While we consume all packages internally in the toddle framework, this project is currently in development and is not yet ready for other applications to consume.

## Plan

As [announced in July '24](https://toddle.dev/blog/toddle-is-soon-open-source), toddle is going open source. The goal is to move more and more code into this repository and make it possible to self host a toddle application.

### Packages

The next packages that will be moved into this repository are:

- runtime ðŸ‘ˆ the runtime needed to run a toddle application on the client
- lib ðŸ‘ˆ the core library of [formulas](https://toddle.dev/docs/formula-editor) and [actions](https://toddle.dev/docs/workflows) used by the runtime (formulas are also used during server-side rendering)
- search ðŸ‘ˆ the code that powers the issue panel in toddle

Also, we plan to move more and more of the server-side rendering logic into this repository.

### Releases

Currently, we're not using GitHub releases, but once the repository is more mature, we will start using them. Later, we also aim to publish the packages to npm/jsr
