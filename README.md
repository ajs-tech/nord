## Introduction

This repository holds different packages that are used internally by the Nordcraft framework. The packages that are currently available are:

- [core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nordcraft/core) ðŸ‘ˆ holds core (shared) logic used by the other packages
- [runtime](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nordcraft/runtime) ðŸ‘ˆ includes logic for hydrating/running/updating a Nordcraft application on the front-end
- [ssr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nordcraft/ssr) ðŸ‘ˆ holds part of the server-side rendering logic
- [lib](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nordcraft/std-lib) ðŸ‘ˆ holds all builtin [formulas](https://docs.nordcraft.com/formulas/overview#the-formula-editor) and [actions](https://docs.nordcraft.com/the-editor/data-panel#workflows) used by the runtime and during ssr
- [search](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nordcraft/search) ðŸ‘ˆ holds all issue rules and search functionality for traversing a Nordcraft project. This powers the issue panel in the Nordcraft editor in a web worker atm

## Requirements

Install using [bun](https://bun.sh/) by running `bun install`

### Commands

- Install: `bun install`
- Lint: `bun lint`
- Check types: `bun typecheck`
- Build: `bun run build` <-- builds all packages

## Status

While we consume all packages internally in the Nordcraft framework, this project is currently in development and is not yet ready for other applications to consume.

## Plan

As [announced in July '24](https://blog.nordcraft.com/toddle-is-soon-open-source), Nordcraft is in the process of going fully open source. The goal is to move more and more code into this repository and make it possible to self host a Nordcraft application.

We're currently working on moving more of the server-side rendering logic into this repository. This means that most updates are going to be in the ssr package for the time being.

## Dependencies

The dependencies between the packages are as follows:

- `core` is a dependency for all other packages
- `ssr` is a dependency for `search`
- `std-lib` is a dependency for `runtime` and `ssr`

## Releases

We use GitHub releases and release to npm atm, which is where we consume packages from internally.

To release a new version to npm:

1. Update the version in the root `package.json` file
2. Create a PR
3. Once the PR is merged, it will automatically release all packages to npm

## Contributing

If you find a bug or have an idea for a new feature, please open an issue. We also welcome pull requests. We are actively monitoring this repository.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask them in our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/svBKYZf3UR) or reach out by [e-mail](mailto:hello@nordcraft.dev)

## Local development

To consume all packages locally, it's useful to run `bun run link` in the root of the repository. This will use `bun link` on all packages in the repository.

Other than that, the best way to test atm is to use the hono example.
